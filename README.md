## ➕ Plus <a name ="plus"></a>

* I started this project with my own [Angular Build](https://github.com/angelinopires/angular7-boot).
* I developed this test thinking in the scalability, acessibility and usability.
* I used the mobile-first concept, so check it out 📱
* You may notice, but in some places I used different icons and background images, cause I couldn't find the right ones.
* I love games, so I puted my heart on this test ❤️
